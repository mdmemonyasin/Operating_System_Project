Question number - 15  

 Write a program to implement priority scheduling algorithm with context switching time. 
 Prompt to user to enter the number of processes and then enter their priority, burst time and arrival time also. 
 Now whenever operating system preempts a process and shifts cpuâ€™s control to some another process of higher priority assume that it takes 2 seconds for context switching(dispatcher latency).
 Form a scenario, where we can give the processes are assigned with priority where the lower integer number is higher priority and then context switch .. as the process waits the priority of the process increase at rate of one per 2 time units of wait. Calculate waiting time and turnaround time for each process.

The Sleeping-Barber Problem. A barbershop consists of a waiting room with n chairs and a barber room with one barber chair. If there are no customers to be served the barber goes to sleep. If a customer enters the barbershop and all chairs are occupied then the customer leaves the shop. If the barber is busy but chairs are available, then the customer sits in one of the free chairs. If the barber is asleep, the customer wakes up the barber. Write a program to coordinate the barber and the customers.
